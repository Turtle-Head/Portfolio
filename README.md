# Projects
**Portfolio of work**
The project is to show my coding work in a grid-based pattern. This includes links to the code produced and links to the content in the case of websites.

It has been *updated* with my work to show off what I have done and provide easy access to projects as an ongoing 
and organic entity.

Initially this project was designed and used prmarily with Knockout.js. I have taken this work and refactored it into a React.js native way to provide 
a demonstration of my ability to create sites using React.js as the main javascript library in use.

The Knockout.js version is: index.html 
The React.js version is: react-index.html.
